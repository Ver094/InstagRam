# InstagRam
A set of utilities for importing Instagram data and extracting features in R


## Note
In order to correctly import data downloaded from Instagram profiles, they should be organized in a single folder per user and every folder should be named with the user ID. 
Folders of all users should then be placed in a single directory, which will be the "Import_dati" function input.
The function will extract the data from every single folder and the name of the folder will be used as user ID.
